      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>This book is a masterpiece.</strong> Kate’s unique writing style is luxurious and descriptive, making acts from hair-pulling to sensory deprivation seem deliciously attainable. With beautiful drawings and tempting “try this” suggestions for beginners and experienced kinksters alike, <em>101 Kinky Things</em> is the perfect coffee table book for saucy date nights.</p>

        <p>A <strong>must-have guide</strong> for couples, throuples and more who are interested in introducing kink into their sex lives, adding variety to their sexual routine, and finding new and exciting ways of keeping their sexual connection hot.

        <p>What I love most about Kate and her eloquent writing is how she can take topics that are often intimidating for the ’mainstream’, and turn them into completely approachable advice, resources, and conversations. <strong>If you're considering expanding your sexual horizons in a healthy, open, communicative way, you'll really enjoy this book.</strong></p>
