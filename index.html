    <h2>Was it good for you?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Kate Sloan is on a mission to help her followers embrace their inner kink in authentic, actionable ways–and in her new book, she delivers. What I love most about Kate and her eloquent writing is how she can take topics that are often intimidating for the ’mainstream’, and turn them into completely approachable advice, resources, and conversations. <strong>If you're considering expanding your sexual horizons in a healthy, open, communicative way, you'll really enjoy this book.</strong></p>
